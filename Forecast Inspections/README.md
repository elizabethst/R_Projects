##Discuss
Using just the type of inspection is a really poor predictor on the type of violation. I have no other indicators to work off of from the austin model but this shows me that what City of Chicago did is actually really clever.  How can we join a bunch of tables behind the scenes to do something that is interesting here?

##PLM model
So using PLM gets a lot closer than the first one.  The R-squared for this model is .002 which is not that good.  What it does tell you though is that you have to be able to use more than just the inspections historical data and the type of inspection to be able to recreate what was done within the City of Chigago.  Repeating this model in a different city is going to require joining a bunch of different tables to get a wholistic picture of the location.
